Other reports claim varying numbers. The original causality figures were lower, but gained in number as time passed and authorities could administer a reliable count.",

Military sources who spoke to journalists in Maiduguri said the soldiers were able to kill about 70 of the terrorists and injure about 30 others. Some reports have the death total as high as 130. The number of soldiers and civilians killed are not known. Despite several sources reporting the fall a Bama to Boko Haram, Xinhua and This Day (Lagos) reports the military repelled the attack, the latter describing the battle as Boko Haram's \"Waterloo.\" It is possible Boko Haram retreated, regrouped, and attacked again. A military airstrike was involved in the battle.",
